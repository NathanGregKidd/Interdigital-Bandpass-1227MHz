# Interdigital-Bandpass-1240MHz
An interdigital microstrip bandpass filter with a center frequency of 1240MHz. Kicad design files, Electromagnetic Simulations, fabrication files, and test data.

Skills showcased:
- Microwave Structures
- Impedence control
- Stackup management
- Keysight ADS (in the form of QUCS, an open source "copy" and following ADS workflows)
- 2.5D Electromagnetic solver and optimization
- PCB design, assembly, and test
- VNA
- Smith Charts
- S parameters

# Summary
This project will showcase my ability to design, fabricate, and test a 1240MHz microwave structure. The design stage will start with calculations. Simulations will be done in QUCS (an open-source version of Keysight ADS) and Sonnet Lite (a free 2.5D Method of Moments EM solver). If possible, a free evaluation license will be acquired for ADS and HFSS in order to validate QUCS and Sonnet Lite as well as build skills. The fabrication stage will be done with KiCad and whichever fab-house works the best. Right now I am expecting to use JLCPCB, with FR4 substrate. The testing stage will be done with a NanoVNA (VNA with LO up to 2GHz) and the VNA results will be compared with the simulation results.

# Current Status
Design Phase
- Currently calculating and setting up a baseline geometry for the filter before optimizing in the simulators.
